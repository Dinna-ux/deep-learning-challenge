# Charity Funding Prediction

This repository contains a neural network model developed to predict the success of funding applications for a charity. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation, with suggestions for potential improvements.

## Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of a neural network model developed to predict the success of funding applications for a charity.

## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of funding applications being successful based on historical data. By accurately predicting the success of applications, the charity can make more informed decisions and optimize their funding process.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset used in this analysis was imported from a CSV file. Initial preprocessing involved dropping non-beneficial columns such as `EIN` and `NAME` and analyzing the unique values in each column.

### Feature Engineering
Application types and classification categories with low counts were binned to reduce the number of unique values. One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.

### Splitting the Data
The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.

### Standardization
Feature data was standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model training.

## Neural Network Model
A neural network model was built with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The model was compiled and trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Results

### Training and Validation Accuracy
The model achieved a training accuracy of approximately 75% and a validation accuracy of around 72%. This indicates that the model generalizes relatively well to unseen data, though there is room for improvement.

### Loss Curves
The training and validation loss curves suggest that the model converged well, with no significant overfitting observed.

### Summary of Overall Results
The neural network model demonstrated moderate accuracy in predicting the success of funding applications. With a validation accuracy of around 72%, the model provides a useful baseline for further improvement.

## Alternative Model
To solve the same problem, a different model such as a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be used. These models are particularly good at handling structured data and can provide feature importance metrics, which can offer insights into which features are most influential in predicting the success of applications. Additionally, ensemble methods like these often achieve higher accuracy and robustness compared to individual models.

## Conclusion
The neural network model provides a solid foundation for predicting the success of funding applications. However, exploring other models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could potentially yield better performance and more insights into the data. Further hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering are recommended to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
